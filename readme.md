# Product CRUD API

This is a basic Product CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (Mongoose). The API allows users to perform operations such as creating a new product, retrieving product details, updating product information, and deleting products.

## Requirements
